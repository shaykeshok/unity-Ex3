<h1>Hangman game</h1>
<div>We did Hangman game that used ui, text, pictures and music.</div>
<div>We use external files to save the words and the description of the word</div>
<div>The subject of the words is the kings of Israel</div>
<br/><br/>
<div>
  <h2>What we did?</h2>
  <p>We add music to the game background </br>
  We use external files to save the words and the description of the word and read these files with json.Parse so it's very comfortable to add words to the game.(row 74-76)
  Every time we rand a word (row 62-63)</br>
  We have folder with pictures of hangman that every picture show one step to hang the man.</br>
  We place the pictures in array
  Every time that the player click on letter that doesn't exist in the specific guess word, we promote the array and display the new picture on the canvas (row 90-91)
  We use ui buttons for all the letters in the English language that display on the canvas.
